# Hanimals

Hacky Balboa (Vertafore Company Hackathon) project by Greg Morgan, Ryan Cooper, and Amanada Taylor.
**Winner of the Practice Makes Perfect Category**

## Goals

As a project in the 'Practice Makes Perfect' category, aimed at personal development and learning, we chose to build a MERN (mongo, express, react, and node) app to explore new stacks and tech. 

## What it does

It puts f@%!in' hands on some f@%!in' animals is what it does.

Hands + Animals = Hanimals

## The stack

The backend of the app was built using node and express, with our database being a mongodb database hosted through mlab, and our front using react. This stack, known as 'mern', has becoming more popular and felt worth exploring by us.
